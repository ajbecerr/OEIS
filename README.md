# OEIS

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks which I have written about various OEIS entries.

Each of these files include code cells which contain functions that I have created to compute terms.

Many of these files also include markdown cells which contain closed formulas, generating functions, or recurrence relations that I have derived.
